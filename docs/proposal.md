##Summary of the Project
The agent will be placed in a cave that contains a number of ores. The agent is tasked with collecting as much valuable ore as possible and returning to the start location before an amount of time elapses. Different ores will have different point values. The agent must seek out and mine the ores.

##AI/ML Algorithms
Machine learning with reinforcement learning.

##Evaluation Plan
A point value will be assigned to each ore. The score is determined by how many of each ore the agent can collect and return to the starting point within the alloted time.
