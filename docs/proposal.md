## Summary of the Project
The agent is going to attempt to navigate a 3D platforming environment towards a known goal. The agent will have information on its immediate surroundings, and its distance to the goal. The agent will have a limited pool of actions which it can perform, such as strafe one block, walk one block forward, or jump two blocks forward.

## AI/ML Algorithms
The agent will use 

## Evaluation Plan
A score will be derived based on distance to the goal and time taken to get there.

## Prototype Goals
The first prototype will aim to navigate simple flat bridges with some holes. The agent will only be able to perceive the immediate 5x5 surroundings. And the agent will only be able to perform the following moves: walk 1 left/right/forward/backward, jump 2 forward.

## Future Goals
As the prototype is clearly very simple, a number of goals for the future have been created. Goals include changing the number of moves available to offer more degrees of freedom, increasing the field of vision, and creating more advanced and sparser environments. If the project is still too simple, we aim to transition to solving 3d platforming puzzles.
